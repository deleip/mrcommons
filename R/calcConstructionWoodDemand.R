  ## Calculate additional wood demand based on Churkina et al 2020
  ## https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0462-4
  ## See SI page 8, part on "Calculations of carbon storage in timber buildings and respective demand for timber"
  ## 35 year demand = (pop diff in 2050-2105) * McW * CW * PR
  ## McW is from Supplementary Table 3   and Supplementary Table 4)
  ## CW is 0.5 (carbon in dry matter)
  ## PR is papers scenarios 0.1,0.5,0.9 etc

  ## Create MWC --- See Table 3 and Table 4 in SI https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0462-4

  ## Create CW i.e. Kg C per Kg of wood
  ## See: Martin, A. R., Doraisami, M. & Thomas, S. C. Global patterns in wood
  ## carbon concentration across the worldâ€™s trees and forests.
  ## Nature Geoscience 11, 915-920 (2018).
  ## Using global average of 0.476 +- 0.04
  cw <- 0.5
